### My Personal Portfolio!

If you've hung out with me in person/ online you'd know about my love for Linux. (I'm sorry in advance haha  ï„Å£‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ î„Å£üíï )

I wanted to do something with my personal website that reflects that. Yep! Navigating my projects, experiences, and more is done through a shell! 


### Tips:
- Type `help` to see an overview of the program.
- Type `clear` to clear the screen!
- Try typing `ls` to see the directories in root directory, such as `skills`, `education` etc.
- To see the content of a particular directory you can type `ls [directoryName]`. Say, for example: `ls skills`.
- To see the content of a particular entry/ file, you can use `cat [fileName]`. For example `cat ta` shows details about my TA experiences at UBC (fun!).
- Whatever you do, don't type `rickroll`! (À∂·µî ·µï ·µîÀ∂)
